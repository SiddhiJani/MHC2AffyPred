# pMHC2Pred: Structural Interaction Fingerprinting of MHC Class II HLA-DR B1 gene Peptide and Affinity Estimation using Machine Learning Approach
Information on MHC class II restricting peptides is profoundly wanted in immunological research, especially with regards to cancer, autoimmune diseases, or sensitivities. The effective techniques for predictions mostly depend on machine learning methods prepared on sequences of experimentally characterized binding peptides. Here, we portray a reciprocal methodology called pMHC2Pred, which depends on Structural collaboration fingerprints (SIFTs) of MHC II-peptide complexes and physico chemical descriptors of peptide. The MHC II complexes were processed and NetMHCIIpan 3.2 peptide dataset were utilized to plan regression models dependent on Structural Interaction Fingerprints.
Biases modeling of peptide sequence datasets were done to optimize binding with corresponding MHC II molecule. SIFTs were created to recognize associating buildups of MHC class II molecule and type of interactions. Shell based scripts were composed for the atomization of the procedure to obtain SIFTs. Regression models were constructed utilizing random forest method (RF) to foresee peptide affinity for the sequence length 9-19. Finally, we provide evidence that pMHC2Pred can complement the current structure and machine learning based methods and help to predict peptide affinity.
